### 🌟 Importance of User-Friendly Design in a Booking System

A successful booking system depends heavily on the quality of its **user experience (UX)**. If users can’t navigate easily, they won’t complete bookings — leading to low conversion rates.

User-friendly design ensures that:
- 🔄 **Booking flows are smooth** with minimal steps and no confusion
- 👀 **Visual hierarchy guides users’ attention** to what matters
- 🧠 **Cognitive load is reduced**, allowing users to make quick decisions
- 📱 **Mobile responsiveness** allows users to book from any device
- 🧩 **Consistency across components** builds familiarity and trust

In short, great UI/UX is not just “design” — it’s a key feature of the product that directly impacts user trust, behavior, and business outcomes.

## 💡 Importance of Good Design

A smooth booking experience increases user trust, satisfaction, and conversions. The platform is designed with:

- **Clear navigation**
- **Minimal friction**
- **Fast-loading pages**
- **Mobile-first responsiveness**
- **Accessible interactions** (WCAG standards)

---

## 🧪 Best Practices

- 📁 Clean, modular file structure
