### 🌟 Importance of User-Friendly Design in a Booking System

A successful booking system depends heavily on the quality of its **user experience (UX)**. If users struggle to navigate, they will abandon the process—leading to lost conversions.

Benefits of a strong user-friendly design:

- 🔄 Booking flows are smooth and intuitive  
- 👀 Visual hierarchy highlights critical actions  
- 🧠 Cognitive load is reduced for quick decision-making  
- 📱 Mobile responsiveness supports any device  
- 🧩 Consistent components build user trust  

Good UI/UX is not just aesthetics—it's **functionality that drives business success**.

## 🧩 UI Component Patterns

### ✅ Navbar
- Logo  
- Search bar  
- User navigation

- Title, price, location, rating  
- "Favorite" button  
- Responsive grid layout  

### ✅ Footer
- Help, About, Terms links  
- Social media icons  
- Copyright  

All components will be designed for **reusability** and **visual consistency**.
